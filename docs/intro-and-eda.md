### Data Resources

We will collect our own data for this project. We were provided a basic Python script, tweepy_script.ipynb, that utilizes the tweepy library [4] to access the Twitter API. We have significantly modified this script to fetch user details and user tweets. This process is detailed in the TwitterDataPreProcessing.ipynb submitted.

We have taken 50 accounts that tweet financial information and 50 bot accounts from different categories(to understand bot behavior). Getting hold of more accounts is difficult, especially bot accounts since Twitter has been clamping down, so we have bootstrapped to increase the user details dataset(shown in TwitterDataEDA.ipynb). 

Tweet details contain many details, most of which can be eyeballed and considered trivial. We have cleaned up these column to focus our EDA on specific columns (shown in TwitterDataEDA.ipynb).
